# FDSMPS Wi-Fi set up for Raspberry Pi


General Information:
Our team wishes to design and build a camera-based security system that uses motion detection and face detection to determine whether an intruder is present on a userâ€™s property. With our Face Detection Security system, properties will be monitored using a motion detector and security camera. Our security system will perform face detection on the security feed, and users will be notified of intrusions through an application on their phone. Users will be able to take action following a notification of intrusion, as well as view a live feed of their property, among other features. However, before starting the Raspberry Pi/ camera needs to be connected to Wi-Fi, this is done by creating a hot spot through the Pi and asking the user to connect to this and enter their Wi-Fi creds. Then the camera will be able to use this data to connect to Wi-Fi
